Toy AMM (Automated Market Maker)
================================
This subdirectory contains a cairo implementation of a simple automated market
maker (`toy_amm.cairo`). There is an 'expected output' file called
`toy_amm.gold` that contains the SMT judgements we expect for each module in
this program.

The `check.sh` script is for running `horus-compile` and `horus-check` together
on a cairo program. You can use it like this:

./check.sh toy_amm.cairo 5000

The first argument is the input cairo program, the second argument is the
`--timeout` flag for the SMT solvers. It runs using `z3` and `mathsat`.

There are several other cairo programs, all of which are efforts to isolate a
bug having to do with the call to `unsigned_div_rem()` in `do_swap()`, and the
form in which we express certain preconditions.

The millisecond suffixes indicate a rough estimate of how long the programs
that ought to result in `Unsat` should take. Your mileage may vary, but since
the SMTs run on a single core, it shouldn't vary *a ton*. This is just to give
the user an idea of the order-of-magnitude so they don't set massive timeouts
and sit there waiting for no reason.

The script also dumps the time it took for `horus-check` to complete, and by
default truncates output to five lines.
